My name is Miguel A Vasquez and I am a senior computer science major at Suny Newpaltz. The first language I started practicing with is C++,  but only very simple pieces of code and I havenâ€™t used c++ in a while. I have taken CS1, CS2, and  CS3 here at New Paltz, and all three of those courses were based on java. CS1 was an introductory course while CS2 and CS3 were based on learning data structures. We used C in assembly to try and translate assembly language to machine language. In language processing we used python to try and mimic how the python interpreter would parse through the code and execute it. In discrete algorithms we learned how to calculate the time effeciency for various algorithms and why certain algorithms are better to use than others. 



I do not currently know what type of job/field I would like to pursue in Computer Science. I am hoping that this semester will help me try and find what field I would like to get into. I am currently taking this course and software engineering. I believe that both of those courses will help me find something that I would like to pursue as they are courses where I will be required to think more creatively.
